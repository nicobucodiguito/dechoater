# Dechoater 
[![made-with-powershell](https://img.shields.io/badge/PowerShell-1f425f?logo=Powershell)](https://microsoft.com/PowerShell) 

This utility combines a bunch of small tweaks with the ability to install some programs in an automatic way through the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager. <br/> 
The intention of this project is to provide users with a toolset for tweaking and optimizing their Windows 10 to their liking mostly by removing useless programs and features Microsoft bakes into fresh Windows installs.<br><br>
**This utility requires internet connection.**

## Examples
|         Tweaks          |         Programs          |

    - By right-clicking the icon and selecting *Open as Administrator*
    - By pressing ```Ctrl+Alt+Enter``` when the **Windows PowerShell** icon shows up in the search box.
2. Paste the following text into the **Windows PowerShell** window and press the ```Enter``` key.

## Notes
For this utility to be able to run directly from the web, everything has been bundled into a single ```.ps1``` file, although this makes the code kind of hard to read and understand, it's the most effective way I've found for this to work properly needing only one command.

GUI was created with Visual Studio 2022 and translated into ```.ps1``` using [LaurentDardenne](https://github.com/LaurentDardenne)'s [ConvertForm](https://github.com/LaurentDardenne/ConvertForm) PowerShell module.
